# SMILES & SMIRKS (VOL-SURFACE)
This application allows the user to visualize the volatility surface for a given equity.  

**ABSTRACT:** The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model is regarded as one of the best ways to price option contracts. It was developed under certain assumptions, one being the volatility is known and constant. The market structure prior to 1987 was in line with this assumption. However, after the stock market crash on that year, traders realized that extreme events could happen and that markets have a significant skew. This earth-shaking event encountered traders with volatility smiles & smirks and caused the development of the volatility surface.
